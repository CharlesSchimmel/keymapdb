summary: "Rationale: Symmetry is important because use-cases are hard to predict. Whenever possible, modifiers and layer keys should be available from either hand. Inward rolls should be leveraged not just for alphas, but also for coding/symbols. Number order—like alpha order—should be designed to favor use of the strongest fingers. One-shot keys can greatly reduce the strain of typing, and should be leveraged."
