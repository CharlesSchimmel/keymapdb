summary: Yet another crkbd keymap which has emerged from a combination of writing and programming using Emacs on MacOS and Linux. The numeric layer has numbers on the home row and shifted symbols on the first row, with commonly used brackets on the third row symmetrically between sides. The emacs layer(s) provide both command and prefix keys.
