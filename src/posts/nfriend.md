#summary: "I looked up character frequency charts for common JavaScript libraries and tried to strategically arrange the symbols on the sym layer to minimize finger movement
#    This keymap also features an “arrow key” layer that allows me to jump around code without leaving the home row, a “window management” layer for snapping windows to certain areas of my monitor,
#    a Unicode emoji layer, and
#    a “Windows” and “macOS” mode that makes all my keyboard shortcuts consistent across the two OSs (still a work in progress)."
