summary: This is a ZMK and QMK config for my 34-36 key split keyboards, arranged in 3 rows of 5 columns with 2 or 3 thumb keys on each side. It uses three non-base layers activated through two thumb keys along with combos. It has <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Shift</kbd> thumb hold-taps along with home row mods. <code>FUN</code> layer is implemented as a tri-layer.
