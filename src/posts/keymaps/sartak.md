summary: "I use the Canary layout on a lightly-modded Ferris Sweep with chocs. I use the lightest switches I can find, currently pinks. I use chords heavily to type entire words, inspired by Plover steno and CharaChorder. I have a duplicate key on a thumb which enables a bunch of functionality. No home row mods due to the presence of word-chords."
