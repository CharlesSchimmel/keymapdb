summary: "The Fulcrum Keyboard is an ergo-mechanical split keyboard with extra thumb functionality. It has 20 keys, two rotary encoders, and two 5-way switches. The 20-key version uses a significant number of combos and features “word keys“: keys on the base layer dedicated to typing a whole word at once, like “the” and “and”."
